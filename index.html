Mr. Martin came from France as a young adult. He always wanted to be a entrepuneur. With his mind set like his, we know he could have been successful no matter what, but we like to believe we helped him get there faster. “NCD helped me gain funding for my coffee company, making it a top selling coffee brand.”</p>
